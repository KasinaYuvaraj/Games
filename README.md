Logic:
      Firstly We Setup Computer Choice which is in an integer
      Then We get Human Result Which is also a integer
      For The Above two we create fubtions and then create PlayRound Function 
      PlayRound function holds the logic which is required for the Game To work
      Each and everytime we send an input the code alerts us the result given by the Computer
      Lastly the code updates the Score Accordingly.
